# AudioDec

AudioDec is an Android native app of MediaX Kotlin code allows you to decode from any video/audio files to raw PCM audio format.

It will save to your internal storage after decoding is done, result folder can be found at `Android/data/org.martineesmaa.audiodec/files/output.pcm`.

Please note if output.pcm still exists, it will overwrite without warning so I have to fix and implement later.
